Welcome to the Maldives vs Lakshadweep SQL Analysis project! This repository contains SQL queries and data analysis aimed at exploring and comparing tourism trends, attractions, and statistics between the Maldives and Lakshadweep islands.

## Introduction

Tourism is a significant industry for many coastal regions and islands, and understanding tourist behaviors, preferences, and statistics is crucial for sustainable development and effective marketing strategies. This project focuses on extracting insights from a database containing information about the Maldives and Lakshadweep, two popular tourist destinations known for their stunning natural beauty and diverse marine ecosystems.
